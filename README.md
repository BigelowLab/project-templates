## The Projects

### **The Setup** style project

A small project that shows one way to organize code and data from [Boothbay Harbor SST Time Series](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science/weather-tides/boothbay-harbor-environmental-data). The project software is kicked off by a single `setup.R` file and includes functions to download data, read CSV files and make simple plots.
