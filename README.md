# project-template
Project templates in R and python (but really could be any language).  This repository provides examples for simple and effective ways to organize projects: small data-analyses, package/module development or bigger data analyses.  Parallel examples in R and python are provided.

## Fork me!

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository, then [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your own fork to your local machine. 

You can also copy the appropriate directory (described below) that fits your project, rather than taking the whole repository. For example, in "R/setup" there is an example directory structure for a "setup" style project.

## Reproducible Research

This talk from OceanHackWeek has some good things to think about before setting up a project, such as best practices for reproducibility and how you might organize your project directories.

## The Projects

### **The Setup** style project

A small project that shows one way to organize code and data from [Boothbay Harbor SST Time Series](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science/weather-tides/boothbay-harbor-environmental-data). The project software is kicked off by a single file that with sources (R) or imports (python) functions in other files and includes functions to download data, read CSV files and make simple plots.
